# 🧪 Unified Python Testing Guide: `utils.py`, `client.py`, & `fixtures.py`

Maintain a single, coherent test suite combining **unit and integration tests**, leveraging shared fixtures from `fixtures.py` for clarity, reuse, and maintainability.

---

## 🎯 1. Objectives

- **Unit Tests**: Validate individual functions in `utils.py` in isolation using mocks.
- **Integration Tests**: Verify interactions across modules—e.g., `client.py` with file I/O, network, or DB—using real implementations wherever feasible and mocking only unreliable externals.

## 🛠️ 2. Project & Test Layout

.
├── 0x03-Unittests_and_integration_tests/
│ ├── test_utils.py
| ├── test_client.py
│ ├── utils.py
│ ├── client.py
│ └── fixtures.py # central shared test fixtures


- **Test file** (`test_utils.py`) contains unit tests.

## ✅ 3. Summary

- **A single test suite** houses both unit and integration tests.  
- **Shared fixtures** from `fixtures.py` streamline setup and teardown.  
- **Mocking is limited and purposeful**; integration tests use real behavior.  
- The final suite is **organized, maintainable, and robust**—with a clear structure that offers fast unit feedback and reliable workflow validation.
